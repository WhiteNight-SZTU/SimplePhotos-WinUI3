# SimplePhotos-WinUI3
A WinUI3 program developed based on Microsoft document.

This program based on the Microsoft official documemt. Heres the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/simple-photo-viewer-winui3?tabs=cs.

Noticed:Haven't test that about whether it can run on other computer. Suggested that instead of trying to run the origin code , you should try to just copy and modify the code  based on the template(The "Click" program) provided by the WinUI3 and then generate the relevant fileon your own computer.
